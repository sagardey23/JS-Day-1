    <h1>JavaScript - Day1</h1>

    <h4>1.What is JavaScript?</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a scripting language (a scripting language is a lightweight programming language).</li>
        <li>A JavaScript  is an interpreted language (means that script execute without preliminary compilation).</li>
        <li>A JavaScript consists of lines of executable computer code.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>2.What is JavaScript Runtime Environment?</h4>
    <p>The JavaScript runtime environment provides access to built-in libraries and objects that are available to a program so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In the context of a browser this is comprised of the following elements:
        The JavaScript engine (which in turn is made up of the heap and the call stack)
       
       
       </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Web APIs</li>
            <li> The callback queue</li>
            <li> The event loop</li>

        </ol>

    <h4>3.What is JavaScript Engine?</h4>
    <p>
        A JavaScript engine is a program which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard like just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.

There are a lot of JavaScript engine according to the browser like Google Chrome (v8),SpiderMonkey (Firefox) and Chakra (IE, Edge).

    <h4>4.What is Execution in JavaScript?</h4>
    <p>
        JavaScript engine creates the execution context in the following two stages:
    </p><br>
    <p>Creation phase</p><br>
    <p>Creation phase is the phase in which the JS engine has called a function but its execution has not started. In the creation phase, JS engine is in the compilation phase and it just scans over the function code to compile the code, it doesnâ€™t execute any code.</p><br><br>
    <p>Execution phase</p><br>
    <p>In the execution phase, JS engines will again scan through the function to update the variable object with the values of the variables and will execute the code.
    </p><br>
